- Copy the displayed command (e.g., `/charlotte nba pull`)
- Post it as a comment on any GitHub issue in the repository
- The workflow will automatically trigger!

**CLI Console:**
- Select a command by number
- View the command details and execution information
- Use the displayed command in GitHub

## Example Workflows

### Morning Data Pull Routine
```bash

## Troubleshooting

### Console Not Working?

**Web Console:**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari recommended)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**CLI Console:**
- Ensure Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
- Make sure you're in the repository directory
- Check file permissions: `ls -l charlotte_console.py`

### Commands Not Executing?

**Remember:** The console shows you the commands but doesn't execute them directly.

To execute:
1. Copy the command from the console
2. Go to any issue in the GitHub repository
3. Post the command as a comment
4. The workflow will trigger automatically

### No Data After Running Command?

1. Check GitHub Actions workflow runs
2. Look for any errors in the workflow logs
3. Verify the workflow completed successfully
4. Check the appropriate data directory

### Need Help?

- Run `/charlotte help` to see all available commands

## Advanced Usage

### Chaining Commands

Post multiple commands in one comment:
```
/charlotte mlb pull
/charlotte batch starter
/charlotte mlb sim pregame
```

They'll execute in sequence!

### Scheduling

The Charlotte bridge automatically runs every 12 hours (00:00 and 12:00 UTC).
You don't need to manually trigger it for routine operations.

### Custom Workflows

You can trigger workflows manually:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Charlotte Control Bridge" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose the branch
